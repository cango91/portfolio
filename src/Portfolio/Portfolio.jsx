        details:`<ul><li>Utilized <b>MEN (MongoDB, Express, NodeJS) stack</b> with EJS (embedded javascript) and Bootstrap5 to build a highly <b>interactive and responsive tele-medicine</b> web application called eyeConnect that connects non-specialist health care providers (HCP) with ophthalmology specialists for <b>early detection of diabetes induced retinopathy (DR)</b> in <b>underserved regions</b> where access to specialized eye care may be limited.</li><li>
        Deployed a previously trained AI system for <b>automatic classification of retina images</b> with respect to DR as a private API for eyeConnect to consume, so as to provide non-specialist HCPs with early guidance.</li><li>
        Followed <b>MVC</b> conventions with added <b>service layer abstraction</b> to decouple business logic from database implementation, used <b>custom middleware</b> to authorize views and actions based on user-role. Followed best practices for a medical data handling application such as enforcing <b>transport layer security</b> between client, backend and AI service as well as implementing <b>encryption at rest</b> for all medical data: exam/consultation notes and images.</li></ul>`,

        2 days before deadline, we had to revise our data-entity model due to an initial oversight in planning phase. Successfully <b>overcame this challenge as a team</b> and were able to deliver a <b>highly polished project.</b></li></ul>
